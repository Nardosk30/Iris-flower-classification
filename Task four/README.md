# 📊 Advertising Sales Prediction

This project predicts **TV advertising sales** based on various media investments (TV, radio, newspaper). It's part of my internship task for CodeAlpha, demonstrating regression techniques using real-world data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

📈 Businesses invest in different advertising channels to boost their product sales.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can **predict sales** based on the **TV advertising budget**.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **📁 Data Loading**  
   Loaded the advertising dataset containing `TV`, `radio`, `newspaper`, and `sales`.

2. **🧹 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for null values and duplicates  
   - Visualized relationships using scatterplots and heatmaps

3. **📈 Model Building**  
   - Applied **Linear Regression**  
   - Used `train_test_split` for evaluation  
   - Evaluated with **MAE** and **R² score**

4. **📊 Result Analysis**  
   - Visualized predicted vs actual sales  
   - Interpreted the regression coefficients

📈 Sample Output
🧠 Model Performance Example:

Train MAE: 10.09

Test MAE: 233.52

Test R²: 0.65
