🌸 Iris Flower Classification System
📊 Machine Learning Project for Iris Species Classification

🎯 Objective
This project aims to develop a complete Iris flower classification system using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It supports end-to-end processing from data exploration and visualization to model training and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and reproducibility.

🔄 Pipeline Overview


📥 Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration
Load the Iris dataset.

Check for missing values and basic statistics.

🧼 Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Drop irrelevant columns (Id).

Encode the target variable (Species) using LabelEncoder.

Split data into training and testing sets (train_test_split).

Standardize features using StandardScaler.

📊 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize feature distributions.

Analyze correlations between features.

🧪 Step 4: Model Training
Train a Logistic Regression classifier.

📈 Step 5: Model Evaluation
Compute accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualize the confusion matrix using seaborn.

💾 Step 6: Model Saving
Save the trained model (Logistic Regression), LabelEncoder, and StandardScaler using joblib.

📊 Visual Outputs
Confusion Matrix: Shows model performance per class.

Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score.

💾 Model Files
iris_classifier_model.joblib: Trained Logistic Regression model.

iris_label_encoder.joblib: Encoder for target labels.

iris_scaler.joblib: Feature scaler for preprocessing.

🧪 Final Performance
Best Model: Logistic Regression

Test Accuracy: 93.33%

Confusion Matrix:

Iris-setosa: 100% accuracy

Iris-versicolor: 90% accuracy (1 misclassified as virginica)

Iris-virginica: 90% accuracy (1 misclassified as versicolor)

🚀 Future Enhancements
Experiment with other classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).

Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.

Add SHAP/LIME for model interpretability.
